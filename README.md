<h2>One Page Responsive Website </h2>

<h4> This project was an HTML5 & CSS3 practice, </br>
  as a way to celebrate my best friend's graduation in bachelor degree I made him a template for a one page responsive website </br>
</br>
  
altho there is a very small javascript file for a hideen navigation which is used for a tablet/phone mode, you can exam it
when you minimaze the window size of the website. </h4>
