# OnePage-Website
---
<p> This project was for html5 &amp; css3 practice, as a way to celebrate my best friend graduation in bechloer degree I made him a template for a one page web that he could use in the near future which could help him find job opportunities! 
altho there is a very small javascript file for a hideen navigation which is used for a tablet/phone mode, you can exam it
when you minimaze the window size of the website. </p>
